As part of their November journal, Public Pedagogies Institute invited me to write an essay about my practice.

### Abstract
Computational Mama met with Diwas Raja Kc for an online conversation about her practice in relation
to artist-led public pedagogies. Computational Mamaâ€™s work explores live coding and computational
thinking as forms of friendship and care. She currently lives in Udaipur, India, in a multi-generational
household of all women and her 5-year-old son. In this rich exchange ranging from feminist theorists,
artists, and coders, they discuss how she chose this moniker as care-giving and motherhood
increasingly impact her practice and strategies of creative facilitation with community.

**Keywords**: caregiving, creative coding, feminist strategies, social practice
