title: Mother Machines Experiments
description: Drawing from observations of lack of mother-like figures in the multitudes of AI generated work, the series is a persistent prompting strategy to generate as many mothers as the machine can churn out. Reproducing mothers not as saintly, but tired, strained, multi-tasking and sometimes in tears! Mother Machines continually pushes the AI model to imagine mother-ing, mother-ness and birthing.

Drawing from observations of lack of mother-like figures in the multitudes of recent AI generated work (early to mid 2022), the series is a persistent prompting strategy to generate as many mothers as the machine can churn out. Reproducing mothers not as saintly, smiling, in happy and faithful servitude, but tired, strained, multi-tasking and sometimes in tears! Mother Machines continually pushes the AI model to imagine mother-ing, mother-ness and birthing.

In the early images, when prompted by an artist's name, you will immediately see the visuals develop as per the style of the artist, but more importantly somehow capturing the some learned ideas about the artist. An almost nuanced understanding, I can't say how.
