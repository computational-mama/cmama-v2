*What do I mean when I say recreating with p5js?*

Have you ever struggled with learning “hello world”? Have you ever been put off by the technical jargon that comes with learning code? I did for several years!! I found no relatability with programming concepts but I saw that it had so many possibilities for me to explore as a creator. I wondered if this was something others struggled with too.

Then I found [zach.lieberman](https://instagram.com/zach.lieberman) had this super cool course at [sfpc_nyc](https://www.instagram.com/sfpc_nyc/) where they were using computer art from the 70s/80s and recreating it with code! It was so radical and I set out to look for Indian artists who had done stuff like that with computer art.

The search was in vain but I discovered some amazing south Asian womxn artists whose work would be exciting to recreate in code!

*I discovered their stories and their processes, this journey was a paradigm shift for my practice as a creator.*

In “Recreating with p5js”, we will explore artists’ works, lives and processes. To recreate with code is first an act of reflection and then an act of making. I’m leaving a few artworks and p5js prompts below, hope you find them as exciting as I do.
