This library from tensorflow allows human pose estimation in real time for 17 body points. I started exploring *posenet* at home with my family and it quickly evolved into being part of a performance, called Mutatis Mutandis that was created by [Agat](https://www.dobedobedo.be/).

I was able to explore this at Algorave India

and then as an overlay for this beautiful piece at Museomix India 2020.

I learnt that it recognises a default of 5 people so I developed a piece called Don't Assemble for PCD 2020
