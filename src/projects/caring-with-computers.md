## Context
In August 2023, the Public Pedagogies Institute invited submissions for its seventh Journal. I was honored to contribute an article on my practice. The editor, [Diwas Raja Kc](https://www.instagram.com/diwasraja/), and I shared engaging discussions about the influence of my feminist upbringing on my workshop formats.

You can read more about it here. The conversations and the final piece have been very critical in how I have started to articulate my practice and pedagogy around creative coding. We discussed deeply about how care can be brought into the learning space and what we might embibe within those spaces. 

## Abstract
Computational Mama met with Diwas Raja Kc for an online conversation about her practice in relation
to artist-led public pedagogies. Computational Mamaâ€™s work explores live coding and computational thinking as forms of friendship and care. She currently lives in Udaipur, India, in a multi-generational household of all women and her 5-year-old son. In this rich exchange ranging from feminist theorists, artists, and coders, they discuss how she chose this moniker as care-giving and motherhood increasingly impact her practice and strategies of creative facilitation with community.
