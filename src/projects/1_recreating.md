*Recreating with p5js* is a workshop format spanning 10 hours over 4 weeks. It is a simple and approachable way for anyone to start learning the basics of coding. This project allows accessibility to those from non-STEM, non-coding  backgrounds to learn creative coding. It has also been easy to break age barriers, the workshop’s oldest student has been a 67 year old retired businesswoman and mother of two! 

**Centering the curriculum in basic art history of women artists, gives the format a strong feminist position of developing a skill that is associated with white male stereotypes.** 

Moving away from the traditional “hello world” basics of computational thinking and coding, the format approaches the basics of javascript coding through recreating artworks of well known womxn artists of South Asia. Featured artists and artworks are mapped to the fundamentals of javascript coding, for example, learning about lines and coordinate systems with Nasreen Mohamedi, for loops through Zarina Hashmi, text and typography through Ayesha Jatoi. 

*Recreating with p5js has been running since July 2020. The workshops have been widely attended with more than 200 students.*
