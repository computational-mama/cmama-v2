title: Archive of Lost Mothers
description: An archive emerges of a secret scientific society that suppressed radical new birthing, new womxn beings developing limbs and post human babies. They were hidden in a secret facility so their birthing prowess could be watched and monitored. Their bodies, their offspring and their energies deleted from the popular imagination.

My partner described the birth of our son to me. The birth was via a c-section, and the graphic details which he shared with me, reminded me of the Alien movie franchise. This idea melded a bit into the post-human explorations of what a mother can be. Always multi-limbed and multi-tasking. 

The idea was to traverse the edge of the generative AI images their macabre and uncanny outputs and extend them into a fictional narrative. Bringing together the images created with generative AI, and the small stories that present themselves as an archive of doctor's notes, and other medical records. 

The project emerges as an archive of a secret scientific society that suppressed radical new birthing, new womxn beings developing limbs and post human babies. They were hidden in a secret facility so their birthing prowess could be watched and monitored. Their bodies, their offspring and their energies deleted from the popular imagination. 

Some of the images were created by me and now after I created a website, that appears like a searchable archive and every search creates a new lost mother image with a new story by anyone one using the search interface. You can try the web interface here:
