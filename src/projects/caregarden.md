I was invited to give a talk about my practice to the BUMP Festival in Belgium, unfortunately we did not get the visa on time. So I shared a video about my practice for the Festival. It seems appropriate at the time to build a small website where people could store their childhood memories with computers as a simple way for me gain something from the event, even though I couldn't make it there in person. 

SIDE NOTE: Often access can be more than meets the eye - it could mean holding a passport that always requires visa approval, it could mean declining work or events because you have care priorities, it could mean budgetary restrictions (a tax for living in smaller towns with less connectivity). I'm grateful for all the affordances of language, privilege and connectivity I have, the "care garden" was a small attempt to build connections even with limited access.
