title: Archive of Lost Mothers
description: An archive emerges of a secret scientific society that suppressed radical new birthing, new womxn beings developing limbs and post human babies. They were hidden in a secret facility so their birthing prowess could be watched and monitored. Their bodies, their offspring and their energies deleted from the popular imagination.

## Context
The project began as a speculative fiction exploration of motherhood and AI. The artist used AI image generation tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion to create surreal, futuristic images of "post-human moms" with evolved features like multiple arms or tentacles. She then crafted narratives around these images, initially writing the stories herself before training an AI to generate them.

## Structure of the project
The project takes the form of a fictional archive, presented as a website (archiveoflostmothers.in). It includes a gallery of AI-generated images, each accompanied by a generated story. The website allows visitors to "search" for more images in the archive, but effectively each "search" generates a new image, making it a collaborative, ever-growing collection. 

## Intended affect
The artist aimed to explore the "silences" and absences in AI representations of motherhood, particularly from non-Western perspectives. By creating surreal, evolved mothers, she sought to speculate on how motherhood might adapt to impossible demands. The project also serves as a commentary on AI biases and the potential loss of diverse representations as AI image generation becomes more prevalent. The interactive nature of the archive invites viewers to engage with these ideas and contribute their own perspectives.
