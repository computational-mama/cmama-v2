As part of my ongoing exploration of body tracking and AI technologies related to it (mainly posenet and handpose libraries built by Googleâ€™s tensorflow), participants and I engaged in a conversation about AI technology, computer vision and machine training and biases. 
The conversation was accompanied by a craft activity. We decided to create small paper chain dolls and other chain based body parts in colored paper to see if the machine could be fooled into recognising our crafty creations as human bodies and human hands. A playful hide and seek like limitations test for these AI technologies. 

The format was devised keeping in mind that participants would have limited connectivity and no access to laptops. 

This activity was part of the larger Makers Meet & Eat held at Utretcht in September 2022.
