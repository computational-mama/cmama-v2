In my experience as a facilitator, learning and imparting knowledge are simultaneous activities and these require everyone to ‘listen’, ‘understand,’ and ‘empathise.’ I think these important verbs also delineate the acts of care-giving. This understanding is not something that came to me naturally but has really come from the experience of being a primary carer.",
